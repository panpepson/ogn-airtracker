The case is designed in a parametric 3D CAD modeller [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)
and printed on a 3D printer from ABS plastics.

There are several case variants:

1. Flat spacy box with powerbank
   * With holder for power bank electronics - see below
   * *I don't recommend print it in the current form*, this was the first prototype,
     there should be some corrections, mainly GPS holder takes needlessly too space,
     it's impossible to plug some micro USB

2. Flat small box with or without powerbank (smaller than variant 1, corrected problems)
   * Subvarinat without holder for power bank electronics
   * *I've never tested this design*, probably the STM32 board holder would require some adjusting
   * Probably too little space inside for my style of wiring
   * **A**: with holder for power bank electronics (`with_battery = true`)
     * [![](https://raw.github.com/peclik/ogn-airtracker/master/doc/img/case-v2.png)]
   * **B**: tiny, without holder for power bank electronics (`with_battery = false`)
     * meant to be powered from external supply directly to STM32 micro USB port

3. Prism long box with powerbank
   * With holder for power bank electronics - see below
   * [![](https://raw.github.com/peclik/ogn-airtracker/master/doc/img/case-v3.png)]

4. Prism short box
   * With holder separate battery charger board
   * *favourite design, but not tested yet*


### Adjustments

The case size can be easily adjusted editing values in `dimensions.scad` file (`box_i_x`,
`box_i_y`, `box_i_z` define inner dimnesions).


### Power bank electronics alternative

As an alternative to the separate battery charger and holder one case use electronics from
power bank [@eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/231432999482) and print the *case variants
with printed holders for battery and electronics*.

Advantages:
* Components a little bit cheaper suprisingly (but longer case costs something too)
* By 2 joints less soldering :-)
* Device can be used as an emergency 5V USB power source (in case other sources around are drained)

Disadvantages:
* To protect battery from undervoltage, the CPU and other stuff should be connected to the 5V bank's output, so it engages one other switching regulator (adding some RF noise around)
* Longer case (more money, longer time to print)
